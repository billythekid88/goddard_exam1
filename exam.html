<p> My name is Billy Goddard and I am a college golfer at Georgia College and State University. I spend most of my free time playing golf, but I also enjoy other hobbies. Another interest of mine is guitar. I have been playing guitar for about 4 years now. It is fun to watch your progression over time and watch yourself get better. Another hobby I have is hunting. There is no better way to take in or to appreciate nature like sitting in a tree in the fall. The smell, the sound, it is all incredible. Another hobby I really enjoy doing is fishing. There is something so peaceful about being on the water and the bonus of reeling any fish in makes for a great day. I am currently in this class because I am exercising my redshirt year in golf and using my last year of eligibility. Most of my joy revolves around the previosly mentioned hobbies, hanging out with teammates, friends, and family. I also really enjoy listening to music, which I think is part of the reason I play guitar. After I graduate I want to get into the sales industry. I already had a sales internship selling cybersecurity and cloud space, and I would really like to work fulltime in the industry.  </p>
